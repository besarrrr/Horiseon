## What, Why, How

The goal of this assignment was to provide a real life example of refactoring code. To complete the challenged I needed to rely on the material learned in module 1. 

I was motivated to apply the conepts learned in class and through the modules.The Html and Css basics learning in week 1 were put to the test because this provided a setting in which I had to critically think to solve problems within the code, meet accessibility standards, and to leave the code better and easier to read than how I found it. 

To complete this challenged I relied on a few different sources of informaton. I used exmaple code from module 1 assignment Run-buddy, my notes from class, and the deep dive links in module 1. This provided a framework in which I worked from to meet the critera needs of the challenge.
