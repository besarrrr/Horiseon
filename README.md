# Horiseon Project

The specific task is to take existing code used by Horiseon Marketing Agency and make it more accesible. Accessibility is important and has increasingly become an important consideration for business. The aim is to make the webpage moore accesible for people with disabilities, ensure that people with socio-economic restrictions have access, and optimized code for search engines by urefactoring the HTML and CSS.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN I find that they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

##  Work Done

* Refacotered HTMl doc to have semantic html elements instead of Div elements and included clear labeled areas such as : "<!-- hero/jumbotron -->"

* Included an Alt tag to all images to meet accessibility standards.

* Ensured all links in the webpage led to the correct location.

* Ordered CCS code to match the flow of the coresponding HTML code.

## What, Why, How

### What:
The goal of this assignment was to provide a real life example of refactoring code.

### Why:
I was motivated to apply the concepts learned in class and through the modules.The HTML and CSS basics learning in week 1 were put to the test because this provided a setting in which I had to critically think to solve problems within the code, meet accessibility standards, and to leave the code better and easier to read than how I found it. 

I also beleive it is important to get as much real life experience as possible. I approached this challenge as I would any work assignment, not as a homework assignement.

### How:
To complete this challenged I relied on a few different sources of informaton. I used exmaple code from module 1 assignment Run-buddy, my notes from class, and the deep dive links in module 1. This provided a framework from which I worked from and used to meet the acceptance criteria of the challenge.
